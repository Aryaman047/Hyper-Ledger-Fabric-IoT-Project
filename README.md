# Hyper-Ledger-Fabric-IoT-Project
HyperLedger Fabric 2022 Project IoT using HyperLedger Composer


# A-Concise-Introduction

IoT and machine learning deliver insights otherwise hidden in data for rapid, automated responses and improved decision making. Machine learning for IoT can be used to project future trends, detect anomalies, and augment intelligence by ingesting image, video and audio.

A consortium of such industries can collaborate and commit themselves to quality via Blockchain. Thus, addressing the two fundamental concerns , i.e., proof and trust.

One such hypothetical business network for distributing the particular machine learning model for an IoT platform. This model of blockchain can be made available on the cloud, o-premises and/or the edge.

Uniquely this architecture provides the following features:-

1. Rapid model deployment to operationalize machine learning quickly
2.Flexibility to use your data science library of choice
3. Safety and Privacy due to Hyperledger

This project was presented on 25-10-2022 for the Virtual LaTrobe University Research Internship under Professor Doan Nguyen.
I lead the team along with my male teammate under our college Mentor Dr. Suchithra M.
